			<h2>Reading Assignment 1:WWW and html</h2>
			<p></p>
			<h4>What are the most essential technologies that made the World Wide Web such a success?</h4>
				<p>Write/Read texts from everywhere and switch files!</p>
			
			<h4>How are resources (html pages, images, etc) addressed in the web?</h4>
				<p>they have an URL</p>
				
			<h4>What are the general components of a url?</h4>
				<p>A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a specific type of URI (Universal Resource Identifier). A URL normally 
				   locates an existing resource on the Internet. A URL is used when a web client makes a request to a server for a resource.</p>
				
			<h2>WEB SERVER</h2>
			<p></p>
			<h4>What is a web server?</h4>
				<p>It is a sever that uses HTTP to serve the files that form Web pages to users, in response to their requests,
				   which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients.</p>

			<h4>What does the web server do?</h4>
				<p>For example, to produce the final webpages you see in the browser, the application server might fill an HTML template with contents from a database. Sites like MDN or Wikipedia have many thousands of webpages, but they aren't real HTML documents, 
				   only a few HTML templates and a giant database. This setup makes it easier and quicker to maintain and deliver the content.</p>
				
			<h4>How can content be stored on a web server?</h4>
				<p>So, you can have what is really a text file that has the html code stored on it. The text file is saved to the server, then when its called to a web browser, it renders in a way that looks good. Or,
				   at least looks how the developer wanted it to. Or, at least looks sort of like the developer wants it to.</p>
				
			<h4>How is content in webpages described?</h4>
				<p>Web content is dominated by the "page" concept, its beginnings in an academic setting, and in a setting dominated by type-written pages, 
				   the idea of the web was to link directly from one academic paper to another academic paper.</p>
				
			<h2>WEB CLIENT</h2>
			<p></p>
				
			<h4>What is a web client?</h4>
				<p>A client-tier component may be an application or Web client. A Web client contains two parts: dynamic Web pages and the Web browser. Dynamic Web pages are produced by components that run in the Web tier,
				   and a Web browser delivers Web pages received from the server.</p>
				
			<h4>What does the web client do? </h4>
				<p>A web client lets the user request something on the server, and shows the user the result of the request.</p>
				
			<h4>Web Client and Web Browser is the same?</h4>
				<p>Web client is the sending and receiving of information where the webserver is storing the information, 
				   the web client can be a number of methods of sending and receiving the data</p>
				
			<h2>HELLO WORLD</h2>
			<p></p>
				
			<h4>What is the html head element?</h4>
				<p>It's the <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed after the <html> tag and for the <body> tag.</p>
				
			<h4>What does <!DOCTYPE` html> mean?</h4>
				<p><!DOCTYPE> is a declaration,it stays before the <html> tag.</p>
				
			<h4>What are the two top most elements within the html element?</h4>
				<p>CSS, JavaScrip</p>
				
			<h4>How to emphasize a text and how is it displayed in the browser</h4>
				<p>The text-emphasis CSS property is a shorthand property for setting text
				   -emphasis-style and text-emphasis-color in one declaration. This property will apply the 
				   specified emphasis mark to each character of the element's text, except separator characters, like spaces,  and control characters.</p>
				
			<h4>How to mark up important ext and how is it displayed in the browser?</h4>
				<p>An important point to cover before I start discussing text, though, is that of space, specifically the space between words. When writing HTML, the source document will contain what is termed �white space� � the characters in the file that serve to separate text. An actual space character, as you would get when you hit the Spacebar on the keyboard is the most common,
				   but there are others such as the Tab character and the marker between two separate lines in a document (called a carriage return or new line).</p>

			<h3> Void Elements</h3>
			<section>
				A void element is any element that can not, by definition, have any content in between the start and end tags, but the only type of data that void elements are allowed to have are attributes. Some examples of void elements that you are probably already familiar with include the img (image), br (break), hr (horizontal rule), and meta tags.

		<h2>CSS</h2>
		
			<h3> Name the components of a css rule proberly</h3>
			<section>
				The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.<br>
				The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.<br>
				Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.<br>
				A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.<br>
			</section>
			
			<h3>Use combinators probably</h3>
			<section>
				A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.<br>
				<br>
				There are four different combinators in CSS3:<br>
				<br>
				descendant selector (space)<br>
				child selector (>)<br>
				adjacent sibling selector (+)<br>
				general sibling selector (~)b´<br>
			</section>

				Gold HEX: FFD700<br>
			</section>
			
			<h3> Declairations for color and background-color</h3>

				<br>
				background-color<br>
				background-image<br>
				background-repeat<br>
				background-attachment<br>
				background-position<br>
			</section>
			
			<h3>Pseudo classes for the a element </h3>
			<section>
				A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.<br>
				<br>
				For example, it can be used to:<br>
				<br>
				Style an element when a user mouses over it<br>
				Style visited and unvisited links differently<br>
				Style an element when it gets focus<br>
			</section>
			
			<h3>Declarations for font style normal and italic</h3>
			<section>
				f people are on your website, they’re probably either skimming quickly, looking for something, or they’ve found what they’re looking for and want to read it as easily as possible. Either way, keeping text readable will help them achieve their goal.<br>
			</section>
			
			<h3>Declarations for font sizes</h3>
			<section>
				The CSS font properties define the font family, boldness, size, and the style of a text.<br>
			</section>
			
			<h3>Declarations for font weights</h3>
			<section>
				When using @font-face to embed a typeface that has several weights and styles, your CSS can become a bit of a mess unless you define those weights and styles in the @font-face declarations. Unfortunately some tutorials and font embedding services do not do this.<br>
